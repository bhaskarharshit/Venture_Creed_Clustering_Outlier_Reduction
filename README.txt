Venture Creed Customer Segmentation Project
===========================================

Project Overview:
-----------------
Venture Creed is a retailer of casino gaming machines. The goal of this project is to segment the customer base into distinct clusters based on purchasing behavior. These clusters will help tailor marketing strategies to different customer segments, improving targeting and optimizing sales efforts.

Business Use Cases:
-------------------
- Launch targeted campaigns (e.g., Benefits Bonanza for loyal customers)
- Increase marketing spend on high potential customers
- Better allocation of sales resources based on segment behavior

Objectives:
-----------
- Generate clusters using unsupervised machine learning
- Identify the optimal number of clusters with a clear rationale
- Map each customer to a respective cluster
- Name and describe each customer segment based on statistical summaries
- Visualize the clusters in a 2D space
- Identify and handle outliers in the data to improve model quality

Approach Summary:
-----------------
1. Clustering Logic:
   - Applied a clustering algorithm to segment customers
   - Evaluated different values for number of clusters
   - Chose the optimal number based on internal validation metrics

2. Feature Selection:
   - Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA)
   - Selected relevant features based on distribution, variance, and correlation
   - Removed redundant or uninformative features

3. Cluster Visualization:
   - Used dimensionality reduction for 2D plotting
   - Created scatter plots to show the separation of clusters

4. Outlier Detection:
   - Detected outliers using statistical methods
   - Applied handling techniques to reduce impact on clustering

Tools & Technologies:
---------------------
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Excel or PPT for summarizing outputs
- Git for version control

Exact results, figures, and cluster labels are excluded from this README. They are available in the full report or notebook upon request.
